This is my portfolio page created with react. Although not the easiest way to deploy a portfolio website, it is a good way to become skilled with reactJS. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I've used Styled Components for accessibly tying CSS to components, and rebase to have flex boxes, and make the page responsive.

It's a work in progress, and still needs implementation off:

- Webpack
- lazy loading of images
